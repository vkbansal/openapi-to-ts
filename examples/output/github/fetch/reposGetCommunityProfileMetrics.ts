 * README, and CONTRIBUTING files.
 *
 * The `health_percentage` score is defined as a percentage of how many of
 * these four documents are present: README, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE, and
 * CODE_OF_CONDUCT. For example, if all four documents are present, then
 * the `health_percentage` is `100`. If only one is present, then the
 * `health_percentage` is `25`.
 *
 * `content_reports_enabled` is only returned for organization-owned repositories.
