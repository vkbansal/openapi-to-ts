/**
 * The API returns a [`301 Moved Permanently` status](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#http-redirects-redirects) if the issue was
 * [transferred](https://help.github.com/articles/transferring-an-issue-to-another-repository/) to another repository. If
 * the issue was transferred to or deleted from a repository where the authenticated user lacks read access, the API
 * returns a `404 Not Found` status. If the issue was deleted from a repository where the authenticated user has read
 * access, the API returns a `410 Gone` status. To receive webhook events for transferred and deleted issues, subscribe
 * to the [`issues`](https://docs.github.com/webhooks/event-payloads/#issues) webhook.
 *
 * **Note**: GitHub's REST API v3 considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this
 * reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by
 * the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue id_. To find out the pull
 * request id, use the "[List pull requests](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/pulls#list-pull-requests)" endpoint.
