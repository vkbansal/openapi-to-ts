/**
 * **Note:** The Checks API only looks for pushes in the repository where the check suite or check run were created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an empty `pull_requests` array and a `null` value for `head_branch`.
 *
 * By default, check suites are automatically created when you create a [check run](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/checks#check-runs). You only need to use this endpoint for manually creating check suites when you've disabled automatic creation using "[Update repository preferences for check suites](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/checks#update-repository-preferences-for-check-suites)". Your GitHub App must have the `checks:write` permission to create check suites.
