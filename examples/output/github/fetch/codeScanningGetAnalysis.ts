/**
 * Gets a specified code scanning analysis for a repository.
 * You must use an access token with the `security_events` scope to use this endpoint.
 * GitHub Apps must have the `security_events` read permission to use this endpoint.
 *
 * The default JSON response contains fields that describe the analysis.
 * This includes the Git reference and commit SHA to which the analysis relates,
 * the datetime of the analysis, the name of the code scanning tool,
 * and the number of alerts.
 *
 * The `rules_count` field in the default response give the number of rules
 * that were run in the analysis.
 * For very old analyses this data is not available,
 * and `0` is returned in this field.
 *
 * If you use the Accept header `application/sarif+json`,
 * the response contains the analysis data that was uploaded.
 * This is formatted as
 * [SARIF version 2.1.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/cs01/sarif-v2.1.0-cs01.html).
 * For an example response, see "[Custom media type for code scanning](#custom-media-type-for-code-scanning)."
 *
 * **Deprecation notice**:
 * The `tool_name` field is deprecated and will, in future, not be included in the response for this endpoint. The example response reflects this change. The tool name can now be found inside the `tool` field.
