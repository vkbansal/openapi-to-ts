 * **Deprecation Notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [Get team membership for a user](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/teams#get-team-membership-for-a-user) endpoint.
 *
 * Team members will include the members of child teams.
 *
 * To get a user's membership with a team, the team must be visible to the authenticated user.
 *
 * **Note:** The `role` for organization owners returns as `maintainer`. For more information about `maintainer` roles, see [Create a team](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/teams#create-a-team).
