/**
 * Find topics via various criteria. Results are sorted by best match. This method returns up to 100 results [per page](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#pagination). See "[Searching topics](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-topics/)" for a detailed list of qualifiers.
 *
 * When searching for topics, you can get text match metadata for the topic's **short\_description**, **description**, **name**, or **display\_name** field when you pass the `text-match` media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/search#text-match-metadata).
 *
 * For example, if you want to search for topics related to Ruby that are featured on https://github.com/topics. Your query might look like this:
 *
 * `q=ruby+is:featured`
 *
 * This query searches for topics with the keyword `ruby` and limits the results to find only topics that are featured. The topics that are the best match for the query appear first in the search results.
