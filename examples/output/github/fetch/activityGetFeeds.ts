/**
 * GitHub provides several timeline resources in [Atom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard)) format. The Feeds API lists all the feeds available to the authenticated user:
 *
 * *   **Timeline**: The GitHub global public timeline
 * *   **User**: The public timeline for any user, using [URI template](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#hypermedia)
 * *   **Current user public**: The public timeline for the authenticated user
 * *   **Current user**: The private timeline for the authenticated user
 * *   **Current user actor**: The private timeline for activity created by the authenticated user
 * *   **Current user organizations**: The private timeline for the organizations the authenticated user is a member of.
 * *   **Security advisories**: A collection of public announcements that provide information about security-related vulnerabilities in software on GitHub.
 *
 * **Note**: Private feeds are only returned when [authenticating via Basic Auth](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/other-authentication-methods#basic-authentication) since current feed URIs use the older, non revocable auth tokens.
