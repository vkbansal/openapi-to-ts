 * To ensure there can always be an active deployment, you can only delete an _inactive_ deployment. Anyone with `repo` or `repo_deployment` scopes can delete an inactive deployment.
 *
 * To set a deployment as inactive, you must:
 *
 * *   Create a new deployment that is active so that the system has a record of the current state, then delete the previously active deployment.
 * *   Mark the active deployment as inactive by adding any non-successful deployment status.
 *
 * For more information, see "[Create a deployment](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos/#create-a-deployment)" and "[Create a deployment status](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#create-a-deployment-status)."
