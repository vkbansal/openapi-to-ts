 *
 * The `author` section is optional and is filled in with the `committer` information if omitted. If the `committer` information is omitted, the authenticated user's information is used.
 *
 * You must provide values for both `name` and `email`, whether you choose to use `author` or `committer`. Otherwise, you'll receive a `422` status code.
