/**
 * **Deprecation Notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new "[Add or update team repository permissions](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/teams#add-or-update-team-repository-permissions)" endpoint.
 *
 * To add a repository to a team or update the team's permission on a repository, the authenticated user must have admin access to the repository, and must be able to see the team. The repository must be owned by the organization, or a direct fork of a repository owned by the organization. You will get a `422 Unprocessable Entity` status if you attempt to add a repository to a team that is not owned by the organization.
 *
 * Note that, if you choose not to pass any parameters, you'll need to set `Content-Length` to zero when calling out to this endpoint. For more information, see "[HTTP verbs](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#http-verbs)."
 * @deprecated
