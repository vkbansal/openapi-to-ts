 * Sets the actions that are allowed in an organization. To use this endpoint, the organization permission policy for `allowed_actions` must be configured to `selected`.

 * If the organization belongs to an enterprise that has `selected` actions set at the enterprise level, then you cannot override any of the enterprise's allowed actions settings.
 *
 * To use the `patterns_allowed` setting for private repositories, the organization must belong to an enterprise. If the organization does not belong to an enterprise, then the `patterns_allowed` setting only applies to public repositories in the organization.
 *
 * You must authenticate using an access token with the `admin:org` scope to use this endpoint. GitHub Apps must have the `administration` organization permission to use this API.
